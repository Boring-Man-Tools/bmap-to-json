MD5 is commonly used for checksums and data integrity verification.\nIts primary function is to generate a unique hash for a given set of data, creating a digital \u0026ldquo;fingerprint\u0026rdquo; that is ideally unique to each distinct input. This irreversible process is useful for verifying the integrity of files, ensuring they have not been altered or corrupted during transmission.\nParallax    Parallax refers to a visual effect where objects in the foreground move at a different rate than objects in the background, creating an illusion of depth.\nThis effect is achieved by displaying multiple layers of images that move at different speeds as the player\u0026rsquo;s viewpoint changes. The closer layers appear to move faster than the more distant ones, mimicking the way objects appear to move relative to each other in the real world.\n"},{"id":6,"href":"/bmap-to-json/bmap-txt/file_format/map_config/","title":"Map Configuration","parent":"File Format","content":"    Full map configuration example Properties  Map properties  Name Author MapWidth MapHeight Ambience   Workshop properties  Preview Workshop   Sea properties  SeaLevel SeaType SeaDepth   Background 1 properties  Bkgd1File Bkgd1MD5 Bkgd1Hspeed Bkgd1Vspeed Bkgd1HPara Bkgd1VPara Bkgd1XTile Bkgd1YTile Bkgd1XOff Bkgd1YOff   Background 2 properties  Bkgd2File Bkgd2MD5 Bkgd2Hspeed Bkgd2Vspeed Bkgd2HPara Bkgd2VPara Bkgd2XTile Bkgd2YTile Bkgd2XOff Bkgd2YOff   Foreground properties  Bkgd3File Bkgd3MD5 Bkgd3Hspeed Bkgd3Vspeed Bkgd3HPara Bkgd3VPara Bkgd3XTile Bkgd3YTile Bkgd3XOff Bkgd3YOff   Color Background properties  BkgdColor1 BkgdColor2 Bkgd1AmbCol Bkgd1Amb   Misc properties  Climb DivChc DecalDepth ShowPath ShowCol ShowLog TotalGates         Full map configuration example    Example of a map configuration with all fields:\n\u0026quot;Config\u0026quot;: { // Map \u0026quot;Name\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;D-Day\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Author\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;Violet\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;MapWidth\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;6528\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;MapHeight\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;2050\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Ambience\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;9\u0026quot;, // Worskhop \u0026quot;Preview\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;BoringManGame_2019-07-31_01-28-42.png\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Workshop\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;1818514010\u0026quot;, // Sea \u0026quot;SeaLevel\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;1920\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;SeaType\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;0\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;SeaDepth\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;2\u0026quot;, // Background 1 \u0026quot;Bkgd1File\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;background2.png\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Bkgd1MD5\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;92043a581db0c50efb7856aa840f885c\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Bkgd1Hspeed\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;0\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Bkgd1Vspeed\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;0\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Bkgd1HPara\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;1\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Bkgd1VPara\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;0\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Bkgd1XTile\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;1\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Bkgd1YTile\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;1\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Bkgd1XOff\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;0\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Bkgd1YOff\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;0\u0026quot;, // Background 2 \u0026quot;Bkgd2File\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Bkgd2MD5\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Bkgd2Hspeed\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;0\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Bkgd2Vspeed\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;0\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Bkgd2HPara\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;0\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Bkgd2VPara\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;0\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Bkgd2XTile\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;1\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Bkgd2YTile\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;1\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Bkgd2XOff\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;0\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Bkgd2YOff\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;0\u0026quot;, // Foreground \u0026quot;Bkgd3File\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Bkgd3MD5\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Bkgd3Hspeed\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;0\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Bkgd3Vspeed\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;0\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Bkgd3HPara\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;0\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Bkgd3VPara\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;0\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Bkgd3XTile\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;1\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Bkgd3YTile\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;1\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Bkgd3XOff\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;0\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Bkgd3YOff\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;0\u0026quot;, // Color background \u0026quot;BkgdColor1\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;4982848\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;BkgdColor2\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;3666080\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Bkgd1AmbCol\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;4210752\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Bkgd1Amb\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;8\u0026quot;, // Misc \u0026quot;Climb\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;0\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;DivChc\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;25\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;DecalDepth\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;-200\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;ShowPath\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;0\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;ShowCol\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;0\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;ShowLog\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;0\u0026quot;, // Other \u0026quot;TotalGates\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;934\u0026quot;, } Properties    Map properties    Name    Description: Name of the map.\nValue: Any string.
