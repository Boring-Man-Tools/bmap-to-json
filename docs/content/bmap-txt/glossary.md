## MD5 Checksum

**MD5**, or Message Digest Algorithm 5, is a cryptographic hash function designed to produce a fixed-size, 128-bit hash value from any input data. MD5 is commonly used for checksums and data integrity verification.

Its primary function is to generate a unique hash for a given set of data, creating a digital "fingerprint" that is ideally unique to each distinct input. This irreversible process is useful for verifying the integrity of files, ensuring they have not been altered or corrupted during transmission.

## Parallax

**Parallax** refers to a visual effect where objects in the foreground move at a different rate than objects in the background, creating an illusion of depth.

This effect is achieved by displaying multiple layers of images that move at different speeds as the player's viewpoint changes. The closer layers appear to move faster than the more distant ones, mimicking the way objects appear to move relative to each other in the real world.
